WebView Example
---------------

This sample Android application loads the embeddable journey planner in a WebView. It shows you how
to ensure that the results are loaded in the same WebView, such that the user can complete their
purchase inside your app, without being directed to their usual web browser.

The initialisation code and the starting point to look at is `MainActivity`.

The example page that is loaded into the WebView is inside `app/src/main/assets`.
